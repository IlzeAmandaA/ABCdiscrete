# ABCdiscrete

A work-in-progress python repository for likelihood-free inference for discrete data

# Contents

At the moment the correct branch is version1
- `main.py` main execution file, can specify a boolean whether to run in parallel programming manner (for faster execution)
- experiments: contains the different experiments settings
- algorithms: contains the algorithms used to perform the approximation of the posterior 
- utils: contains functions for plotting and text file generation 
- results: stores the output files of each run 


# Updates

The repository is in a developing stage. Currently, working on benchmark implementation
